The command logic is a set of rules and procedures that determine how the computer system responds to user input and commands. 
It is responsible for interpreting user commands and executing the appropriate actions to fulfill the user's instructions. 
This logic is integrated into the system's operating software and is executed whenever a user interacts with the system through a command-line interface.
